# Everything is Better with Friends: Using SAS in Python Applications with SASPy and Open-Source Tooling


### Materials from online classes as part of [Western Users of SAS Software](https://www.wuss.org) online conference offerings throughout 2021 and early 2022.

Materials provided:

- To be added: exercise files and full solutions


## Setup Instructions & Prerequisites

### Accounts Needed

In order to interact with code examples, accounts for the following two online services will be needed:

- Google
  - We'll be using Google accounts to run code examples in [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  - If you don't already have a Google Account, you can create one for free at [https://accounts.google.com/signup](https://accounts.google.com/signup) 

- SAS OnDemand for Academics (ODA)
  - We'll be accessing ODA accounts from Google Colab, which will require you to know the Region associated with your ODA account. (The Region for an ODA account is typically displayed in the upper-right corner after logging in.)
  - If you don't already have an ODA account, you can create one for free at [https://welcome.oda.sas.com/](https://welcome.oda.sas.com/)
  - Note: To create an ODA account, you will also need a SAS Profile account. If you don't already have a SAS Profile account, you can create one for free using the "Don't have a SAS Profile?" link on the ODA login page.

To test your setup, please follow the instructions in our [Setup Test Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16lrkpnth_BTx0VPRgUoXBZbnyShdL-3J#offline=true&sandboxMode=true). If desired, you can use the __File__ -> __Save a Copy in Drive__ command to save a copy of the results.

All in-class examples assume the use of Google Colab and ODA, and we will not be able to provide support for any other setup. However, if you are interested in setting up a local SASPy enviroment in order to have Python talk to a commercial SAS installation, you're welcome to follow [these setup instructions](https://github.com/saspy-bffs/sgf-2019-how/blob/main/Handout-SGF2019-HOW-Everything_Is_Better_With_Friends.pdf) (see page 2) from a previous iteration of this course.


### Attendee Prerequisites

Our __Getting Started__ class on 29NOV2021 is designed for SAS programmers of all skills, and only assumes familiarity with Base SAS, including DATA steps and PROC steps. Some examples also assume familiarity with the Output Delivery System, PROC SQL, and the SAS Macro Facility. No familiarity with Python or JupyterLab is assumed.

Our __Beyond the Basics__ class on 06DEC2021 is designed for intermediate to advanced SAS programmers, but assumes only basic familiarity with Python syntax and pandas DataFrames. No knowledge of JupyterLab is assumed, and it's not necessary to have taken our __Getting Started__ class beforehand.

For both classes, we recommend a relatively new computer with a broadband internet connection and a modern web browser.


## Learning Outcomes

After successfully completing this class, we will be equipped for the following:

- Using Google Colab for Python script development, including linking to SAS OnDemand for Academics to access the SAS analytical engine.

- Using SAS and Python together with SASPy, include understanding the trade-offs of completing common data-science tasks in SAS and Python.
